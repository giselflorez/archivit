- [ ] Connect Source Extraction to real video transcription (Whisper)
- [ ] Add speaker diarization (pyannote) for multi-speaker videos
- [ ] Transcribe key video interviews for cognitive mapping
- [ ] Build NER extraction (spaCy) for entity tags
- [ ] Implement claim detection model
- [ ] Add cross-reference system linking to existing knowledge bank
- [ ] Build topic clustering for semantic search
- [ ] Create connection visualization (knowledge graph)
- [ ] Implement novelty scoring (new vs known info)

### Founder Intent (This Session)
## FOUNDER INTENT CAPTURES (This Session)

> "make sure to keep all relevant details about where it is from who published it what year and any other variable that may be needed for complete cognitive mapping of time and details"

> "actual video interviews of all the ones that are alive or were alive during the video tech so we can see what they were like in real life"

> "transcribe all those videos so we can comprehend and apply their special abilities to our action bank of data that is trained on verifiable human outputs"

> "when making a button on the app of DOC-8 it would be very useful when researching like this for the user to always be able to verify the sources that will be added all at once even before it gets started"

> "show ALL sources that will be researched for the whole query ahead"

> "so that data can be understood quick and accurate and visible to the person deciding if that website or source is legit enough for their additions to the NORTHSTAR trainings locally to themselves"
