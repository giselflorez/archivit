> *Your data. Your identity. Your sovereignty.*

**⚠️ WORKING BUILD** — Active development. Report glitches via Issues tab above.

## What is ARCHIV-IT?

A **local-first, user-sovereign** creative intelligence platform.

No cloud dependency. No data harvesting. No algorithmic manipulation.

Your data lives on YOUR device. You own your seed. You control your identity.

---

## The -8 Ecosystem

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **DOC-8** | Archive & Verify — Store, search, and authenticate your creative work |
| **CRE-8** | Create & Iterate — Generate from 968 trained intelligences across 8 domains |
| **SOCI-8** | Share & Connect — Selective publishing with provenance (coming soon) |

---

## Core Principles

**USER TAKES ALL**
- Your data — lives on your device, not our servers
- Your identity — mathematically derived, you own your seed
- Your creations — everything you make belongs to you
- Your export — take it all, anytime, any format
- Your deletion — when you delete, it's gone

**ANTI-EXTRACTION**
- We don't harvest your data
- We don't track your behavior
- We don't monetize your attention
- Algorithms serve you, not platforms

## 968 Intelligence System

8 domains of creative knowledge:

```
VISUAL ARTIST    MUSICIAN       WRITER         POET
MATHEMATICIAN    SPIRITUALIST   DESIGNER       PERFORMER
```

Each domain trained on verified quotes, philosophies, techniques, and inspirations from masters historical and living.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the interface
./venv/bin/python scripts/interface/visual_browser.py

# Open in browser
http://localhost:5001
```

---

## What You Can Do

**Archive**
- Import your creative work (images, documents, videos)
- Search semantically across everything
- Verify provenance and authenticity

**Create**
- Access 968 trained intelligences
- Generate with guidance from masters
- Iterate in 4D spatial canvas

**Own**
- Export everything, anytime
- No lock-in, no walled gardens
- Local-first, cloud-optional

---

## Data Sources (All Optional)

- **Local Files** — Direct import
- **Google Drive** — Sync folder automation
- **Social Archives** — Twitter, Instagram export import
- **Web Import** — Manual URL capture

No external AI APIs required. No subscriptions. No dependencies.

## For Developers

See `CLAUDE.md` for agent instructions and architecture details.

```
scripts/interface/     — Web interface (Flask)
scripts/collectors/    — Data importers
scripts/search/        — Semantic search
data/                  — Your knowledge base
```

---

## Privacy

- All data stored locally
- Embeddings generated offline
- No telemetry, no tracking
- Works completely offline

---

## Philosophy

> *"Ancient magic looking to build the future to see the past"*

ARCHIV-IT exists because creatives deserve tools that respect their sovereignty. Your creative output is yours. Your data is yours. Your identity is yours.

We connect to decentralized infrastructure (blockchains, IPFS) — we are not decentralized infrastructure ourselves. We are **sovereign-first**, not decentralized-first.

Built with intention.
