People who talk about:
- **Local-first** software
- **User sovereignty** / data ownership
- **Anti-extraction** / anti-surveillance
- **Human-AI collaboration** (not replacement)
- **Open source** as principle, not marketing

## Red Flags (NOT Aligned)

- "Web3" but everything is on AWS
- "Decentralized" but requires their token
- "AI-powered" but scrapes without consent
- "Open" but funded by surveillance capital
- Talks sovereignty, builds walled gardens

## Outreach Approach

Don't pitch. Show the work.

1. Share the verification engine concept
2. Share the collaboration philosophy
3. Ask: "Does this align with what you're building?"
4. Let them self-select

The right people will recognize it.
