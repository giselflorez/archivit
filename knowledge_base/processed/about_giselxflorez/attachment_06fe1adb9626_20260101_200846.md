Expanding light upon the photographic medium Gisel is developing new
manual & cinematic techniques exploring paths of particle & wave
through a lens of the post-digitized era. Currently finalizing
#Moonlanguage “Verse of a Visual Universe”. A non-literal alphabet of
verse, painted in-camera in dance with the moon. This collection holds
an array/variation of lunar frequencies, rotations, impressions, cloud
formations, TransmissionsofLight, digital noise & atmospheric interference. 968 iterations of lunatic channeling
formed as asemic verse. This generative play uses a sea of options during each capture: inertia, force,
momentum of camera within positional axis, aperture, focus & depth of field. Documenting these messages
over the span of the last year has developed my tuning to the moon for when it was visually receptive to
collaborate. This collection is token numbered in order by date of capture, rich in metadata and personally edited
into this specific potency. Leading artistic initiatives Gisel is exploring new paths towards autonomy for creatives
& photography in web3. Based in New York, Co-founder @helloWOCA (Women of Crypto Art), Art advisor to
@Theverseverse, Genesis floor room @MuseumofCryptoArt
