Thank you for catching this - it perfectly illustrates why rigorous verification is so important. In my final collection of 1000 genuine moon quotes, I should NOT have included this altered version. The real Anne Frank quotes about the moon from her diary (if any exist) would be about actually seeing the moon from the Secret Annex, not philosophical additions to her other statements.  base on my last conversation make a list of verifiable quotes on the moon through history to get a collective feeling for how others contemplated it through actual documented quotes writings or video interviews. this is the sample list last made.  only use the quotes that have not been hallucinated

export this as csv

this is the worst list, i need the variation similar to my last list of quotes but all 1000 need to be verifiable from sources throughout history & accurate to the quotes or documentation records in written or video

Search extensively and compile every verifiable moon quote I can find (likely 100-300 genuine quotes, not 1,000) and then
Create a rigorous methodology for you to continue building the list yourself with proper verification

my last conversation did much more in depth research this is nothing the same this is not work the membership

not all men! more from all over the world and not the typical people

yes as long as it is accurate with authentic quotes that have not been reappropriated and dont stop until you found 1000 and make into a csv
