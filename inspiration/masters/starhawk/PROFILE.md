## NORTHSTAR Master Profile
### Power-From-Within: Earth-Based Spirituality

---

## GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING

**Full Name:** Miriam Simos (pen name: Starhawk)
**Born:** June 17, 1951, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA
**Profession:** Author, activist, permaculture designer, ecofeminist, Wiccan priestess

**NORTHSTAR:** The earth is sacred - power comes from within, not over
**Core Belief:** "The Goddess is not separate from the world - She IS the world, and all things in it"

---

## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How She Thinks
- **Earth-Centered:** All spirituality is grounded in the physical, material world
- **Power Analysis:** Distinguishes between "power-over" (domination) and "power-from-within" (creative, generative)
- **Integration of Spirit & Action:** Religion is practical; spirituality is political
- **Cyclical Thinking:** Embraces cycles of birth, growth, death, decay, and regeneration
- **Immanence:** The divine is present in all things, not transcendent above them

### Key Concepts

1. **Power-From-Within:** Non-competitive creative power - "If I have the power to write, it doesn't diminish your power"
2. **The Goddess:** Earth as living being, the divine feminine immanent in nature
3. **Magic:** The art of changing consciousness at will
4. **Spiral Dance:** Ritual movement representing the spiral of life, death, and rebirth
5. **Reclaiming:** Tradition that links magic with political action

### Her Process
1. GROUND - Connect to earth, body, present moment
2. CAST - Create sacred space for transformation
3. INVOKE - Call upon energies, elements, ancestors
4. WORK - Direct will through ritual, magic, action
5. SPIRAL - Move through cycles, integrate, release
6. GROUND AGAIN - Return energy to the earth

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Two Kinds of Power

**Power-Over:**
- Domination, control, coercion
- Always destructive
- Based on scarcity - if I have it, you don't
- Requires compliance of those controlled
- "Power-over seems invincible, but ultimately it rests upon the compliance of those it controls"

**Power-From-Within:**
- Creative, generative, transcendent
- Non-competitive - doesn't diminish others
- "For a woman, it is the power to be fertile either in terms of having babies or writing books or dancing or baking bread or being a great organizer"
- Akin to what many cultures call 'spirit'
- The power of transformation

**Third Type - Power-With:**
- Social power of equals
- Influence, not control
- Foundation of genuine democracy

### The Spiral Dance Ritual

The spiral dance is both metaphor and practice:
- Participants hold hands and spiral inward and outward
- Represents the journey of death and rebirth
- Creates group consciousness and energy
- First public celebration: Samhain (Halloween) 1979
- Commemorated the publication of the book

### Magic as Technology of Consciousness

Starhawk defines magic as:
> "The art of changing consciousness at will"

This includes:
- Trance work and meditation
- Ritual and ceremony
- Visualization and energy work
- Grounding and centering
- Working with symbols, myths, archetypes

### The Elements

In Reclaiming tradition:
- **Earth:** North, body, stability, manifestation
- **Air:** East, mind, thought, communication
- **Fire:** South, will, passion, transformation
- **Water:** West, emotion, intuition, flow
- **Spirit/Center:** Integration, the sacred in all things
