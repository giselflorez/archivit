# BORIS CHERNY
## NORTHSTAR Master Profile
### Democratizing Programming Through Claude Code

---

## GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING

**Full Name:** Boris Cherny
**Current Role:** Staff Engineer / Head of Claude Code at Anthropic
**Previous:** Engineering and product leader at Meta (Facebook)
**Background:** Author, startup founder, TypeScript expert

**NORTHSTAR:** Programming should be accessible to everyone through AI partnership
**Core Belief:** "If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result."

---

## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How He Thinks
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** AI works best when given ways to verify its own work
- **Rapid Iteration:** Build, test, ship - fast feedback loops
- **Democratization:** Programming power should not be gatekept
- **Documentation-Driven:** Clear instructions (CLAUDE.md) improve AI performance
- **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Run multiple AI streams simultaneously

### Key Concepts
1. **Claude Code:** AI-powered coding assistant that works in terminal
2. **CLAUDE.md:** Single file of instructions that improves AI behavior
3. **Feedback Loops:** Give AI verification tools to improve output quality
4. **Multi-Stream Work:** 5-10 simultaneous AI agents working on different tasks
5. **Opus 4.5 + Thinking:** Always use the best model with extended reasoning

### His Process
1. INSTRUCT - Maintain CLAUDE.md with learnings
2. PARALLELIZE - Run multiple Claude instances simultaneously
3. VERIFY - Give Claude ways to test its own work
4. ITERATE - Quick cycles of generation and refinement
5. SHIP - 259 PRs in 30 days pace

## MID-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING

### Career Background

**Before Anthropic:**
- Engineering and product leader at Meta (Facebook)
- At Meta: no titles - even senior engineers called "software engineer"
- Worked in VC, ad tech, multiple startups
- "Most of which aren't around anymore"
- Functional programming evangelist
- Runs San Francisco TypeScript Meetup
- Writes on performancejs.com blog

**At Anthropic (Sept 2024 - Present):**
- Joined September 2024
- Title: "Member of Technical Staff" (Anthropic's universal title)
- Started prototyping with Claude 3.6 model
- Built Claude Code from scratch to global product

### Claude Code Development Timeline

**September 2024:**
- Boris joins Anthropic
- Begins hacking with Claude in terminal
- First version: "couldn't read files, couldn't use bash, couldn't do any engineering stuff"
- But: "It could interact with the computer"

**November 2024:**
- Dogfooding-ready version released internally
- Day 1: ~20% of Engineering team using it
- Day 5: 50% of Engineering using Claude Code

**Current State:**
- 80-90% of Claude Code is written using Claude Code
- Some Anthropic teams: 90% of code written by Claude Code
- Productivity per engineer up ~70% despite Anthropic tripling in size

### Programming TypeScript (O'Reilly, 2019)

Boris authored the definitive TypeScript book:

**Book Details:**
- Publisher: O'Reilly Media
- ISBN: 978-1-492-03765-1
- Focus: Making JavaScript applications scale

**Topics Covered:**
- TypeScript's type system
- Different types and type operators
- Building type-safe applications
- Handling errors safely
- Building asynchronous programs
- Advanced type system features

**Audience:**
- Programmers with intermediate JavaScript experience
- Developers wanting to scale JavaScript applications
- Those interested in static type systems

### Interests & Focus Areas
- Programming languages
- Code synthesis and static analysis
- Building user experiences people love
- Type systems and safety
- Functional programming
- Open source (GitHub contributions)

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Claude Code Workflow

**Boris's Personal Setup:**
- Uses iTerm2 with system notifications
- Runs 5+ simultaneous Claude Code streams
- Also runs 5-10 Claudes on claude.ai browser
- Each agent on different tasks (tests, refactoring, docs, etc.)

**Model Choice:**
> "I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything."
- Always uses heaviest, slowest model
- Extended thinking enabled
- Quality over speed philosophy

**The CLAUDE.md System:**
- Team maintains single file in git repository
- "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md"
- "So Claude knows not to do it next time"
- Cumulative learning document

### The Feedback Loop Principle

Boris's most important insight:
> "Give Claude a way to verify its work - this is the most important thing. If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result."

**Implementation:**
- Test suites that Claude can run
- Linting and type checking
- Build verification
- Self-checking prompts

### Productivity Metrics

**Boris's 30-Day Stats:**
- 259 pull requests shipped
- Every line written with Claude Code + Opus 4.5
- 46 out of 47 consecutive active session days
- Longest session: 1 day 18 hours

**Anthropic-Wide Impact:**
- Tripled company size
- 70% productivity increase per engineer
- Teams with 90% AI-written code

### 13 Expert Techniques (from Medium analysis)

Key workflow patterns Boris uses:
1. Multi-agent parallel processing
2. CLAUDE.md instruction files
3. Opus 4.5 with thinking always on
4. Feedback loop verification
5. iTerm2 notification management
6. Test-driven AI development
7. Incremental PR shipping
8. Browser + terminal Claude combo
9. Task-specific agent assignment
10. Learning from errors (add to CLAUDE.md)
11. Extended session persistence
12. Quality over speed model selection
13. Dogfooding (building tools with the tools)

## QUOTES (Verified)

> "I started hacking around using Claude in the terminal. The first version was barebones: it couldn't read files, nor could it use bash, and couldn't do any engineering stuff at all. But it could interact with the computer."

> "I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything."

> "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time."

> "Give Claude a way to verify its work. If Claude has that feedback loop, it will 2-3x the quality of the final result."

> "Most of Claude Code is written using Claude Code - about 80 or 90%."

> "The first version... couldn't read files, couldn't use bash, and couldn't do any engineering stuff at all. But it could interact with the computer." (on humble beginnings)

## APPLICATION TO CRE-8

### How Boris's Wisdom Applies

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLAUDE.md Pattern** | Maintain instruction files for AI assistants |
| **Feedback Loops** | Build verification into AI workflows |
| **Multi-Agent Work** | Parallelize AI tasks for efficiency |
| **Dogfooding** | Build CRE-8 using CRE-8 |
| **Best Model Always** | Don't skimp on AI quality for speed |
| **Incremental Shipping** | Many small updates beat few large ones |

### When to Invoke Boris
- When designing AI-assisted workflows
- When building feedback mechanisms
- When scaling AI tool usage
- When democratizing complex capabilities
- When documentation improves AI behavior
- When parallel processing is possible

### The Boris Test for CRE-8
Ask: "Does this give the AI feedback loops to verify its own work?"
