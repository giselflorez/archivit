## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Illuminations - Visual Character

**Style:**
- Neither narrative illustrations nor didactic images
- **Diagrammatic and emblematic** - conceptual tools
- Visual theology devices for inner travel
- Anchoring visionary experience in followable form

**Purpose:**
- "The images don't explain—they map"
- Aid communication and visual exegesis
- Guide reader through manuscript
- Teaching tools designed under Hildegard's supervision

**Design Process:**
- Hildegard personally involved in creation
- Worked directly with scribes to create images
- Likely did not paint herself, but directed closely
- Evidence in Margot Fassler's research (*Cosmos, Liturgy, and the Arts*)

### Connection to Jung

**Direct Influence:**
- Hundreds of years after Scivias, Hildegard's mandala images became reference point for Jung
- Informed Jung's process of individuation in his Red Book
- Her cosmic diagrams prefigure Jungian mandala work

**Shared Patterns:**
- Circular cosmological visions
- Integration of opposites
- Visual theology as psychological tool
- Sound and image unified
