> "A personal brand is not about becoming famous. It's about becoming known for something valuable."

> "You don't need to be an expert. You need to be one step ahead of who you're helping."

> "The future belongs to the generalist who can specialize on demand."

> "Your past struggles are the curriculum for your future business."
