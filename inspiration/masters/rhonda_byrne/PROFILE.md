## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Three Steps

**STEP 1: ASK**
- Get clear on what you want
- Be specific and detailed
- The universe needs your order

**STEP 2: BELIEVE**
- Have unwavering faith
- Act as if it's already done
- Don't question the how

**STEP 3: RECEIVE**
- Feel good NOW
- Align your feelings with having it
- Allow it to come

### Thought Frequency Concept

From The Secret:
> "Energy vibrates at specific frequencies; our thoughts are magnetic with their frequencies too. Our personal vibrations are determined by our thoughts and feelings. When we think of something, we are transmitting these frequencies to the Universe, like a human transmission tower, and they magnetically attract things of the same frequency."

### The Power of Gratitude

**From The Magic:**
- 28-day gratitude practice program
- Each day focuses on a specific gratitude exercise
- "You are the builder of your life, and gratitude is your magical tool"

**Gratitude Practices:**
1. Count your blessings
2. Gratitude rock/object
3. Gratitude lists morning and evening
4. Thank people in your life
5. Gratitude for future events (as if done)

### Visualization Technique

> "The reason visualization is so powerful is because as you create pictures in your mind of seeing yourself with what it is you want, you are generating thoughts and feelings of having it now. Visualization is simply powerfully focused thought in pictures, and it causes equally powerful feelings."

**Key Elements:**
- Create vivid mental images
- Engage all senses
- Generate the feeling of having it NOW
- Practice daily, especially before sleep

### The Power - Love as Ultimate Force

From The Power (2010):
- Love is the most powerful force in the universe
- Every good thing in your life is attracted through love
- Fear and negativity repel; love attracts
- "Life doesn't just happen to you; you receive everything in your life based on what you've given"

### Affirmative vs. Negative Thought

> "An affirmative thought is 100 times more powerful than a negative one."

This suggests:
- Focus on what you want, not what you don't want
- Positive thoughts have greater attractive power
- Cancel negative thoughts with positive ones
- Guard your mental garden
