**Died:** January 7, 1943, New York City, USA
**Profession:** Inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, futurist

**NORTHSTAR:** Free energy for humanity
**Core Belief:** "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."
**Secondary:** "If you only knew the magnificence of 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe."

## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How He Thought
- **Visualization:** Could visualize inventions complete in his mind before building
- **Eidetic Memory:** Claimed to have perfect recall of images and text
- **Obsessive Patterns:** Strong affinity for numbers divisible by 3
- **Holistic Systems:** Saw electricity as part of universal energy flow
- **Future-Oriented:** Many inventions ahead of their time (wireless power, remote control)

### His Process
1. VISUALIZE - See the complete invention in mind's eye
2. REFINE - Mentally test and iterate without building
3. CALCULATE - Mathematical verification of principles
4. BUILD - Only construct after mental model perfected
5. DEMONSTRATE - Public demonstration to prove concept

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The 3-6-9 Theory

**Note:** While widely attributed to Tesla, historical documentation is limited. The principles align with his known interests in resonance and harmonics.

**Applied Interpretation:**
- **3** = Foundation, stability, creation (triangle)
- **6** = Efficiency, balance, completion of cycle
- **9** = Completion, transcendence, return to source
- Pattern: All numbers reduce to 3, 6, or 9 through digital root
- Musical application: A=432Hz tuning relates to these harmonic patterns

### Key Inventions & Schematics

#### Alternating Current (AC) System
- **Revolutionary Impact:** Enabled long-distance power transmission
- **War of Currents:** Tesla/Westinghouse AC vs Edison DC
- **Polyphase System:** Multiple overlapping AC currents for efficiency
- **Rotating Magnetic Field:** Foundation of AC motor operation

#### Tesla Coil (1891)
- **Purpose:** High-voltage, low-current, high-frequency AC electricity
- **Applications:** Wireless transmission experiments, X-ray research
- **Resonant Transformer:** Creates standing waves of electrical energy

#### Wardenclyffe Tower (1901-1917)
- **Vision:** Worldwide wireless power transmission
- **Design:** 187-foot tower with 68-foot copper dome
- **Principle:** Earth resonance for power distribution
- **Status:** Demolished 1917, never completed
- **Legacy:** Concept of wireless energy still being researched

#### Radio/Wireless Communication
- **Patent Priority:** US Supreme Court ruled (1943) Tesla had priority over Marconi
- **Key Concept:** Tuned circuits for selective frequency transmission

### Mathematical Concepts

#### Resonance
- Every object has natural frequency
- Energy transfer maximized at resonance
- Applied to: Wireless power, earthquake machine experiments

#### Standing Waves
- Stationary wave patterns
- Used in Tesla coil operation
- Theoretical basis for global power transmission

## QUOTES (Verified)

> "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."

> "The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."

> "My brain is only a receiver, in the Universe there is a core from which we obtain knowledge, strength and inspiration."

> "I don't care that they stole my idea... I care that they don't have any of their own."

> "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."

> "Of all things, I liked books best."

> "Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born."
