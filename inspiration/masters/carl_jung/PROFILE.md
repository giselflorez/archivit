## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How He Thought
- **Depth Psychology:** The unconscious holds the key to wholeness
- **Symbolism:** Dreams, myths, and art reveal unconscious patterns
- **Archetypes:** Universal patterns exist in collective unconscious
- **Integration:** Shadow must be acknowledged, not suppressed
- **Individuation:** Life's goal is becoming authentically oneself

### Key Concepts
- **Shadow** - Repressed aspects of personality
- **Anima/Animus** - Contrasexual inner figure
- **Self** - Center and totality of psyche
- **Persona** - Social mask we present
- **Collective Unconscious** - Shared ancestral memories
- **Archetypes** - Universal symbolic patterns
- **Synchronicity** - Meaningful coincidences
- **Mandala** - Circular symbol of wholeness

### His Process
1. ENCOUNTER - Face the unconscious (dreams, active imagination)
2. RECOGNIZE - Identify archetypal patterns
3. INTEGRATE - Acknowledge shadow elements
4. TRANSCEND - Unite opposites (transcendent function)
5. INDIVIDUATE - Become authentically whole

### Mandalas

**Definition:** Sanskrit for "circle" - symbolic diagram representing the cosmos and psyche

**Jung's First Mandala:** "Systema mundi totius" (1916) - cosmic representation of spirituality and soul

**Discovery:** "I painted my first mandala in 1916, but it wasn't until a few years later that I began to understand how my drawings corresponded to my inner situation at the time."

**Function:**
- Express and organize psychic content

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Shadow

**Definition:** Unconscious aspect containing repressed weaknesses, desires, and instincts

**Formation:** Parts of ourselves rejected by ego and society get pushed into shadow

**Projection:** We see our shadow qualities in others (what irritates us in others often reflects our shadow)

**Integration Process:**
1. Recognize shadow projections
2. Withdraw projections from others
3. Accept shadow elements as part of self
4. Transform shadow energy into conscious use

**Quote:** "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious."

### Archetypes

| Archetype | Description | Symbols |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Self** | Totality, center | Mandala, God-image |
| **Shadow** | Rejected aspects | Dark figure, monster |
| **Anima** | Inner feminine (in men) | Goddess, muse |
| **Animus** | Inner masculine (in women) | Hero, wise old man |
| **Persona** | Social mask | Clothing, titles |
| **Hero** | Overcoming obstacles | Warrior, savior |
| **Wise Old Man** | Wisdom, guidance | Sage, mentor |
| **Great Mother** | Nurturing/devouring | Earth, nature |
| **Trickster** | Transformation through chaos | Fool, shapeshifter |

### Active Imagination

**Definition:** Technique for engaging directly with unconscious images

**Method:**
1. Enter relaxed, receptive state
2. Allow images to arise spontaneously
3. Engage with images as autonomous beings
4. Record experience through writing or drawing
5. Reflect on meaning and integrate insights

**Red Book Origin:** Jung developed active imagination through his own "confrontation with the unconscious" (1913-1930)

### Synchronicity

**Definition:** "Meaningful coincidence" - acausal connecting principle

**Examples:**
- Thinking of someone who then calls
- Dream that predicts waking event
- Meaningful symbol appearing at crucial moment

**Principle:** Psyche and matter connected at deeper level than causality
