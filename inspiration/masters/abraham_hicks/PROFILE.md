---

## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How They Think
- **Vibrational Universe:** Everything is energy vibrating at specific frequencies
- **Emotion as Guidance:** Feelings are your GPS to alignment
- **Allowing Over Forcing:** Let desires come; don't chase them
- **Joy as Purpose:** Life is meant to feel good
- **Eternal Expansion:** You are consciousness that never ends, always expanding

### Key Concepts
1. **Law of Attraction:** Like attracts like; your vibration draws matching experiences
2. **The Vortex:** Vibrational holding space where your desires already exist
3. **Art of Allowing:** Releasing resistance to let well-being flow
4. **Emotional Guidance System:** Feelings tell you if you're aligned or resistant
5. **Deliberate Creation:** Consciously directing thought toward what you want

### The Process
1. WANT - Desire is born from contrast (knowing what you don't want)
2. ASK - Contrast causes you to ask (happens automatically)
3. SOURCE ANSWERS - The universe immediately responds (always yes)
4. ALIGN - Bring yourself into vibrational alignment with the desire
5. ALLOW - Release resistance and let it come

### Origin Story

**1985 - The Beginning:**
- Jerry and Esther Hicks read the Seth Material by Jane Roberts

**The First Contact (Late 1985):**
- Phoenix, Arizona living room
- Esther felt involuntary movements during meditation
- "I was convulsing in ecstasy, making noises... The energy was so strong that my teeth were buzzing"
- Her head began moving - nose writing letters in the air
- Spelled out: "I am Abraham. I am your spiritual guide. I love you. I am here to work with you."

**The Freeway Incident:**
- While driving between two 18-wheelers
