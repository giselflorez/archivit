1. **The Spatial Web:** Web 3.0 that connects physical and digital spaces
2. **HSTP/HSML:** New protocols that embed context in every interaction
3. **Active Inference:** AI that learns like biological systems
4. **Context-Aware Computing:** Systems that understand place, time, and meaning
5. **KOSM:** Network operating system for adaptive intelligence

### His Vision
1. CONTEXTUALIZE - Every person, place, thing has embedded meaning
2. CONNECT - Link physical and digital seamlessly
3. TRUST - Enable secure, verifiable interactions
4. ADAPT - Systems that learn and improve autonomously
5. GOVERN - Ethical standards for intelligent systems

## MID-LEVEL UNDERSTANDING

### The Spatial Web Book (2019)

**Full Title:** "The Spatial Web: How Web 3.0 Will Connect Humans, Machines and AI to Transform the World"
**Co-Author:** Dan Mapes
**Foreword:** Jay Samit

**Core Thesis:**
The Spatial Web lets us use a digitally-mediated universal language where all information becomes spatial. It enables information to be placed contextually on objects and at locations, where we can interact with it naturally - by looking, speaking, gesturing, or thinking.

**Topics Covered:**
- Evolution from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0
- Convergence of AR/VR, AI, IoT, robotics, blockchain
- HSTP and HSML protocols
- Challenges of fake news, surveillance capitalism
- Risks of algorithmic terrorism, biological hacking, "fake-reality"
- Call for governance and global cooperation

**Key Quote:**
> "It makes our world smarter as it adds intelligence and context to any place, any object, and every person that we encounter."

### VERSES AI Company

**What VERSES Does:**
- Cognitive computing company specializing in next-generation AI
- Modeled after natural systems and human brain design principles
- Flagship: KOSM - network operating system for adaptive intelligence

**KOSM Platform:**
- Transforms disparate data into universal context
- Fosters trustworthy collaboration between humans, machines, and AI
- Works across digital and physical domains
- Built on open standards

**Genius Product:**
- Operating system for "continually learning autonomous agents"
- Operates at the edge of connected devices
- Built on 30+ scientific papers from VERSES researchers
- Beta users include NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Volvo

### Partnership with Karl Friston

**Who is Karl Friston?**
- Most cited neuroscientist in the world
- Authority on brain imaging
- Creator of the Free Energy Principle
- Pioneer of Active Inference

**The Partnership (December 2022):**
- Friston joined VERSES as Chief Scientist
- His Active Inference theories central to Genius development
- Approaches AI using design principles from nature
- Relates intelligent systems to biological principles found in body and nature

**Friston's Quote:**
> "VERSES' steadfast dedication to pioneering the commercialization of Active Inference research is already yielding exceptional results."

### Leadership Roles

- Executive Director, VERSES Foundation (non-profit for Spatial Web standards)
- Founding Member, IEEE Ethics Certification Program for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (ECPAIS)
- Global Board Member, Virtual Reality Augmented Reality Association (VRARA)
- Founding Member, AR Cloud Association
- Advisor to multiple AI, XR, and Blockchain organizations

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### HSTP & HSML: New Web Protocols

**The Problem with Current Web:**
- HTTP/HTML don't carry context
- Data is isolated, not interoperable
- No universal understanding between systems

**The Solution:**

**HSTP (Hyperspace Transaction Protocol):**
- Replaces HTTP for spatial interactions
- Embeds context in every transaction
- Enables secure, verifiable exchanges

**HSML (Hyperspace Modeling Language):**
- Replaces HTML for spatial content
- "Bakes context into every single person, place or thing in any space, both real and virtual"
- Universal language for humans, machines, AI

**Result:**
More interconnected and context-aware digital environment leading to personalized, efficient interactions.

### Active Inference AI

**What It Is:**
Theoretical framework describing how agents maintain internal states and behavior aligned with goals.

**The Free Energy Principle:**
- Organisms maintain internal states by minimizing difference between beliefs and reality
- Actions and perceptions both serve to reduce "free energy" (surprise/uncertainty)
- Foundation created by Karl Friston

**How VERSES Uses It:**
- AI agents with predictive and adaptive abilities
- Agents autonomously share knowledge with other agents
- Can generate new agents
- Creates self-sustaining web of intelligence

**Difference from Current AI:**
- Not just pattern matching (like LLMs)
- True learning and adaptation
- Operates like biological systems
- Continually improving at the edge

### The Spatial Web Promise

**For Users:**
- Interact with information by looking, speaking, gesturing, or thinking
- Natural and intuitive digital experiences
- Context-rich interactions

**For Systems:**
- Every object has embedded intelligence
- Location-aware and situation-aware
- Trustworthy and verifiable exchanges
- Decentralized computing and storage

**For Society:**
- More secure digital interactions
- Better governance of AI
- Interoperable standards
- Ethical frameworks for emerging tech

### Challenges Identified in The Spatial Web

**Current Risks:**
- Fake news and misinformation
- Surveillance capitalism in Web 2.0
- Algorithmic terrorism
- Biological hacking
- "Fake-reality" manipulation

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Common-sense governance
- Global cooperation
- Interoperable standards for software code
- Ethical and social codes
- Business and government support for standards

## QUOTES (From Gabriel Rene)

> "The Spatial Web lets us use a digitally-mediated universal language in which all information can become spatial."

> "It makes our world smarter as it adds intelligence and context to any place, any object, and every person that we encounter."

> "It allows our relationships with each other and this new network to be more trustworthy, more secure, and faster by decentralizing and distributing the computing and storage of the data."

> "HSTP and HSML 'bake context into every single person, place or thing in any space, both real and virtual.'"

(On Active Inference partnership with Friston:)
> "Professor Friston's revolutionary theories on Active Inference have been central to the creation and continued development of Genius, as well as their broader cognitive computing initiatives."

## APPLICATION TO CRE-8

### How Gabriel's Wisdom Applies

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Context is Intelligence** | Archives must embed context, not just content |
| **Spatial Awareness** | Location and relationship data enriches meaning |
| **Active Inference** | Systems that learn and adapt to user behavior |
| **Open Standards** | Interoperability and long-term accessibility |
| **Human-Machine Collaboration** | Natural interfaces for human-AI interaction |
| **Trust & Verification** | Provenance and authenticity for archived content |

### When to Invoke Gabriel Rene
- When designing context-aware systems
- When building spatial/location features
- When integrating AI that learns
- When standards and interoperability matter
- When trust and verification are needed
- When physical-digital integration is relevant

### The Gabriel Test for CRE-8
Ask: "Does this embed context into content so that meaning is preserved across time and systems?"
