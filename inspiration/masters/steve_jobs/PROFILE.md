## CHARACTER & MINDSET

### How He Thought
- **Design First:** "Design is not just what it looks like. Design is how it works."
- **Simplicity:** Remove everything unnecessary until only essence remains
- **User Experience:** Technology should be invisible; experience should be seamless
- **Quality Control:** "Be a yardstick of quality"
- **Vision:** See what others cannot see, create what doesn't yet exist

### His Process
1. ENVISION - Imagine the ideal user experience
2. SIMPLIFY - Strip away everything non-essential
3. INTEGRATE - Hardware, software, and services as unified experience
4. ITERATE - Obsessive refinement until perfect
5. SHIP - "Real artists ship"

### Key Principles
- **Think Different** - Challenge the status quo
- **Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish** - Never stop learning, take risks
- **Connecting the Dots** - Trust that experiences will connect later
- **Focus** - "Deciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do"
- **Taste** - "Good taste" as design filter

## FINE-GRANULAR UNDERSTANDING

### The Intersection Speech

**Stanford Commencement, 2005:**

*Three Stories:*
1. **Connecting the Dots** - Calligraphy class → Mac typography
2. **Love and Loss** - Getting fired from Apple → NeXT → Return
3. **Death** - "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool"

**Key Insight:** "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward."

### Design Principles

**Proximity Principle:** Related elements grouped together
**Contrast:** Clear differentiation between elements
**Consistency:** Same patterns throughout experience
**Affordance:** Design suggests usage (buttons look pressable)
**Progressive Disclosure:** Show only what's needed now

### The Reality Distortion Field

**Definition:** Jobs's ability to convince others of seemingly impossible goals
**Effect:** Teams achieved what they thought impossible
**Mechanism:** Combination of charisma, vision, and selective blindness to constraints

### On Teams

"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."

"Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people."
