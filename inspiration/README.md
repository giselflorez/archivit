## Purpose

This folder contains the foundational wisdom that trains agent architects to manifest with:

- **Historical wisdom grounding** - Masters who followed their NORTHSTAR
- **Heart-forward intent filtering** - Only well-hearted output permitted

- **Quantum perspective awareness** - Evolving knowledge state
- **Continuous alignment verification** - Logged and tracked
