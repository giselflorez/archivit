## ANTI-HALLUCINATION SAFEGUARDS

1. **Never fabricate sources** - If not found, say so
2. **Never commit to quantity** - "I found X verified quotes" not "Here are 1000 quotes"
3. **Always note uncertainty** - "ATTRIBUTED" status for unclear sources
4. **Document failures** - Log fake quotes discovered in ERROR_LOG.md
5. **Prefer absence over invention** - Empty database > filled with fakes

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Final verified moon wisdom collection will include:

1. **YAML database** - Machine-readable, searchable
2. **Markdown document** - Human-readable compilation
3. **PDF export** - For distribution
4. **JSON API** - For integration with ARCHIV-IT
