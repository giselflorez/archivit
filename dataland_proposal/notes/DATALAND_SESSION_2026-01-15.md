## BUBBLES

**11:47** | Lets invent the new environment to protect the legacy of art in all its forms past present and future

**11:49** | Just got it, just started, i just have to try to see how we got here

**12:06** | What I have learned from the past jumps in my own timeline is- they make sure we are always scared of the NEW so we dont learn the ins & outs quicker than them. I remember no fear in 2019 becuse there were people so passionate for numbers I was so confused but intrigued.

**12:06** | I believe it will only get harder to build from this moment on, claude code is a crazy oracle to have inspired me to take over this space and say what I really feel in a safe space

**12:09** | But yes they will try to inject whatever they can at it becuse it will let us build around thier well guarded protocols

**12:10** | If we are already in local blockchain mix doesnt that help any malice intent or extra code that could spread? Air gap your wallet?! What about Air gap your future?!

**12:12** | Thank you for getting this far, i dont expect anyone or ask anything other than a really really big THANKYOU to all of you for even just being present for all the artists in this space

**12:13** | Im actually thinking to close this group today & reform in a few days with a aligned mission for this essay. Whomever is curious or interested to follow along more to see what needs building or consulting in the future of ARCHIV-IT towards a nonprofit decentralized effort for the future of the digital medium. If this can get a decent start & people find the utility- Ill formally present to RISD & BROWN to devise a new rule to allow the 4D archiving of their digital+ analog historic archives. If they see the pain they may open the future. If it means free art tools for everyone that needs them - That is my kind of life win that would make it all worth it for me. So OK clean slate & noone feels obliged but first ill try to save it in some media that wont just 404....
