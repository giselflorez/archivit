Whomever is curious or interested to follow along more to see what needs building or consulting in the future of ARCHIV-IT towards a nonprofit decentralized effort for the future of the digital medium. If this can get a decent start & people find the utility- Ill formally present to RISD & BROWN to devise a new rule to allow the 4D archiving of their digital+ analog historic archives. If they see the pain they may open the future. If it means free art tools for everyone that needs them - That is my kind of life win that would make it all worth it for me. So OK clean slate & noone feels obliged but first ill try to save it in some media that wont just 404....",
