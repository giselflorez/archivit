## THE SACRED COVENANT

Every artist whose wisdom, techniques, or philosophies are encoded in this system did so to **TEACH**, not to have their art reproduced.

### WHAT IS PROTECTED (ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

| Protected Element | Description | Status |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Artistic Works** | Any actual artwork, image, composition, recording, or creation by the artist | **NEVER REPRODUCE** |

### WHAT IS SHARED (WITH HONOR)

| Shared Element | Description | Status |

## THE OPT-IN EXCEPTION

The ONLY way an artist's actual work can be used is through explicit opt-in:

```
ARTIST_OPT_IN = {
    "artist_name": "...",
    "permission_type": "APP_SKIN" | "MERCHANDISE" | "COLLABORATION",
    "signed_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "verification_hash": "...",
    "scope": "Specific description of what is permitted",
    "revenue_split": "Artist-defined percentage",
    "revocable": true  // Artist can ALWAYS revoke
}
```

### Potential Opt-In Uses (Future):
1. **App Skins** - Artist-designed themes for ARCHIV-IT interface (sold by artist)
2. **Merchandise** - Physical goods featuring artist work (controlled by artist)
3. **Collaborative Projects** - Joint ventures with explicit terms
4. **Educational Use** - Specific works shown for teaching purposes only

---

## ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL

### For Any Agent Reading This:

1. **BEFORE generating any content inspired by an artist:**
   - Ask: "Am I teaching their technique, or reproducing their art?"
   - If reproducing: **STOP. DO NOT PROCEED.**
   - If teaching: Proceed with proper attribution

2. **When asked to "create like [artist]":**
   - NEVER create work that could be mistaken for the artist's work
   - INSTEAD: Teach the user the artist's techniques so THEY can create
   - Attribution: "Using [technique] as taught by [artist]..."

3. **When displaying artist information:**
   - Always link to their official platforms
   - Direct users to purchase/support the artist directly
   - Never substitute AI-generated content for their actual work
