## PART 1: WHAT YOU'VE INVENTED (Inventory)

Before protecting anything, you must know what you have:

### A. Novel Technical Implementations

| Discovery | Description | Prior Art Status |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Pi-Quadratic Seed Identity** | Mathematical identity derivation using π and golden ratio | NOVEL - No known prior art |
| **Quantum Containment (ACU-Gated Access)** | Gaming-resistant access control using Fibonacci weighting | NOVEL - Unique approach |
| **PQS + PQC Bridge** | Behavioral identity + post-quantum crypto unified engine | NOVEL - Unique combination |
| **Quantum Provenance Model** | Superposition-based disputed ownership modeling | NOVEL - Conceptual innovation |
| **Seed-Derived PQC Keys** | Deterministic quantum-safe keys from user entropy | IMPLEMENTATION - Method is novel |
| **Golden Ratio Access Thresholds** | φ-based mathematical access control levels | NOVEL - Application is unique |

### B. Novel Conceptual Frameworks

| Framework | Description | Protectable? |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Deep Provenance** | Multi-dimensional (not linear) artwork history | COPYRIGHT (documentation) |
| **Sovereign-First Architecture** | User owns all data, identity mathematically derived | TRADE SECRET + COPYRIGHT |
| **NORTHSTAR Alignment Scoring** | Rating systems based on 22 masters' principles | COPYRIGHT (methodology) |
| **Equilibrium of Light** | Behavioral balance requirements for access | COPYRIGHT + potential PATENT |

### C. Implementation Details

| Component | File | Protection Strategy |
|-----------|------|---------------------|
| Core seed algorithm | `pi_quadratic_seed.js` | TRADE SECRET until patent filed |
| Quantum integration | `pqs_quantum.js` | OPEN SOURCE (defensive) |
| Access control math | Quantum Containment spec | PATENT CANDIDATE |
| Provenance model | Deep Provenance Framework | COPYRIGHT + potential PATENT |

## PART 2: PROTECTION MECHANISMS

### A. Timestamps & Prior Art Establishment

```
STRENGTH HIERARCHY (weakest to strongest):

1. Local file timestamps        → Easy to fake, weak evidence
2. Git commits (local)          → Better, but can be rewritten
3. Git commits (pushed remote)  → Good - GitHub timestamps are trusted
4. Signed git commits (GPG)     → Strong - cryptographically verified
5. Blockchain anchoring         → Very strong - immutable public record
6. NIST Beacon + PQC signature  → Strongest - quantum-proof, NIST-backed
7. Patent filing                → Legal protection, not just evidence
```

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use levels 4-6 for all critical discoveries.

### B. Documentation Requirements

Before ANY disclosure, you must have:

Subject: Post-Quantum Cryptography Implementation for Digital Archive Sovereignty

Dear [Name],

I've implemented a post-quantum cryptographic system for protecting
creative digital archives, using NIST-standardized ML-KEM-768 and
ML-DSA-65 algorithms.

Key innovations:
1. Hybrid classical+PQC signatures for defense-in-depth
2. User-sovereign identity derived from local seed (non-custodial)
3. Novel approach to disputed provenance modeling

I'm seeking feedback on the approach and potential academic collaboration.

Would you be open to a brief discussion? I can share technical details
under appropriate agreements.

[Your name]
[Your credentials]

## PART 5: QUANTUM-SIGNING YOUR DISCOVERIES (Implementation)

The strongest protection is cryptographic proof of prior creation.

### Create Invention Records

```javascript
// Use the QuantumSeedEngine to create timestamped invention records

async function createInventionRecord(invention) {
    const record = {
        title: invention.title,
        description: invention.description,
        claims: invention.claims,
        inventors: invention.inventors,
        conceptionDate: invention.conceptionDate,
        reductionToPractice: invention.reductionToDate,

        // Hash of actual implementation
        implementationHash: await hashFile(invention.sourceFile),

        // Git evidence
        gitCommit: await getLatestCommitHash(),
        gitRemote: await getRemoteUrl(),

        // Timestamp
        createdAt: Date.now()
    };

    // Sign with quantum-safe signature
    const signedRecord = quantumSeed.createProvenanceRecord(
        record,
        new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(record))
    );

    // Add NIST beacon for institutional verification
    const beacon = await fetchNISTBeacon();
    signedRecord.nistBeacon = beacon;

    return signedRecord;
}
```

### Store Invention Records

```
Location: /discoveries/signed/
Format: JSON with embedded PQC signatures
Backup: Git (pushed), IPFS (optional), local encrypted backup

Each file is:
1. Quantum-signed (ML-DSA-65)
2. NIST beacon timestamped
3. Git commit referenced
4. Content-hashed (SHA-384)
```

## PART 6: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

### Will Google Quantum Team "Steal" Your Work?

**No, for several reasons:**

1. **Misaligned interests** - They research quantum hardware, not archive software
2. **Reputation risk** - Major companies avoid IP disputes
3. **Citation culture** - Academics prefer to cite, not steal
4. **Your work is applied** - They do fundamental research

**Real risks:**
- They might not respond (they're busy)
- They might not find it relevant to their work
- They might point you to existing solutions you missed

### Will They "Honor" Your Invention?

**If your work is novel and useful:**
- Academic citation in relevant papers
- Potential collaboration opportunities
- Feedback that improves your approach

**How to maximize this:**
- Publish a preprint on arXiv first
- Create a clear, citable reference
- Make it easy for them to acknowledge you
