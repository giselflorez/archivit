Open-source sovereign archive platform. DOC-8 • CRE-8 • NFT-8 • SOCI-8. Post-quantum cryptography. User-owned identity. Founded by WEB3GISEL.
```

### Long Description

```
ARCHIV-IT Foundation builds open-source tools for sovereign digital archives and creative preservation.

## The -8 Ecosystem

ARCHIV-IT comprises four integrated modules:

• **DOC-8** — Database & Archive: Source verification, provenance tracking, institutional-grade preservation with post-quantum signatures.

• **CRE-8** — Create & Rate: Spatial design tools for organizing creative work, thought streams, and knowledge mapping.

• **NFT-8** — Collect & Verify: Multi-chain NFT provenance scanning, authenticity verification, collector tools.

• **SOCI-8** — Share & Connect: Community features for creators and collectors (in development).

## Core Principles

**Sovereign-First, Not Decentralized-First**

We are honest about what we are:
• Local-first application (your data stays on YOUR device)
• Connects to blockchains (reads, verifies) but doesn't run on them
• User-sovereign identity (you own your seed, your keys, your data)
• Anti-extraction design (no tracking, no harvesting, no monetization of users)

## Technical Innovations

• **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: First archive platform implementing NIST-standardized ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65—signatures valid for 50+ years against quantum threats.

• **Pi-Quadratic Seed Identity**: Novel mathematical identity system using golden ratio geometry.

• **Quantum Provenance Model**: Amplitude-based system for modeling disputed ownership—handles real-world ambiguity mathematically.

• **NIST Beacon Timestamps**: Unforgeable timestamps anchored to NIST Randomness Beacon.

## Why Open Source

Sovereignty requires transparency. You can't trust what you can't verify.

• All code released under AGPL-3.0
• Cryptographic implementations use audited libraries (@noble/post-quantum)
• Community can verify every claim we make
• No vendor lock-in—export everything, anytime

## Use of Funds

• Core development and maintenance
• Security audits of cryptographic implementations
• Documentation and educational resources
• Community building
• Infrastructure (minimal—local-first architecture)

## Founded by WEB3GISEL

Independent researcher and artist building tools for creative sovereignty. ARCHIV-IT emerged from the need to protect and preserve creative work without surrendering it to extractive platforms.

## COPY-PASTE MISSION STATEMENT

**One Sentence:**
```
ARCHIV-IT Foundation develops open-source, quantum-resistant infrastructure for sovereign digital preservation.
```

**Elevator Pitch (30 sec):**
```
Every digital archive today uses encryption that quantum computers will break. ARC-8 is open-source infrastructure that lets artists, libraries, and communities preserve their cultural heritage with post-quantum cryptography—secure for decades, not years. Local-first, user-sovereign, no vendor lock-in.
```
