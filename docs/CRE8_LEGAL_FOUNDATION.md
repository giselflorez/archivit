## RELATED PROJECT: MOONLANGUAGE

### Overview

MOONLANGUAGE is an artistic project by Gisel Florez consisting of 968 multimedia artworks. CRE-8/ARC-8 serves as the archive and visualization layer for these assets.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Collection Size | 968 unique works |
| Asset Layers | 4 per moon (photo, video, ASCII, quote) |
| Blockchain | Ethereum + Bitcoin Ordinals |
| Audio | Plutonic Mind (432Hz compositions) |
| Web Interface | SCUUBE / Nick van Dorp |

### Technical Implementation

- WebGL-based 3D/4D viewer
- Timeline navigation (Moon 1 through 968)
- Golden spiral galaxy view (968 moons in formation)
- Live demo: `moonlanguage-web3d-demoenv.vercel.app`

### Viewer Interaction States

| State | Trigger | Display | Audio |
|-------|---------|---------|-------|
| DEFAULT | None | Static photograph | Silent |
| ANIMATE | Hover | Video plays until complete | 432Hz (Plutonic Mind) |
| ASCII | Click + Hold | ASCII art (easter egg) | Silent |
| RELEASE | Let go | Returns to previous state | — |

### Asset Structure (Per Moon)

```
/assets/moon_XXX/
├── photo.jpg       # Static photograph
├── video.mp4       # Animation with audio
├── ascii.png       # ASCII version
└── quote.json      # Historical moon quote (verified source)
```

### Blockchain Layer Mapping

| Asset Type | Chain | Format |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Interactive (photo + video) | ETH | Dynamic webGL-HTML |
| ASCII Inscription | BTC Ordinals | Immutable text mirror |
| Quote Metadata | On-chain | #COSMICDOWNLOAD encoding |

### Quote Data Integrity

Each moon contains a historical quote about the moon sourced from verified books, teachings, or recordings. All quotes require:

- Manual confirmation before final integration

No AI-generated or hallucinated quotes are permitted.

### Future Development

Live performance capabilities are planned but not yet implemented.

## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

### What CRE-8 Is NOT

| Competitor Type | CRE-8 Difference |
|-----------------|------------------|

2. **Local-First:** User controls all data
3. **Reputation System:** Trust metrics based on on-chain behavior
4. **Spatial Visualization:** 3D/4D navigation of archives
5. **Artist-Built:** Created by an artist for artists
