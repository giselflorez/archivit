## TESTIMONIAL TEMPLATE

**Request email:**
```
Subject: Would you share your ARC-8 experience?

Hi [Name],

Thank you for being an early tester of ARC-8. We're applying for grants
to support continued development as open-source infrastructure for
cultural preservation.

Would you be willing to provide a brief testimonial (2-3 sentences)
about your experience? This would help us demonstrate real-world value
to funders.

Questions to consider:
- What problem does ARC-8 solve for you?
- How is it different from other tools you've tried?
- Would you recommend it to others?

Your words will only be used with your permission, and you can review
before publication.

Thank you for your support,
[Name]
ARCHIV-IT Foundation
