# ARCHIV-IT by WEB3GISEL

## What It Is

ARCHIV-IT is a personal archive system for digital art and NFTs. It reads your blockchain history and transforms it into something you can see, understand, and preserve.

## The Problem It Solves

**For Artists:**
- Your creative output is scattered across multiple blockchains, marketplaces, and wallets
- There's no unified view of your body of work over time
- Metadata, provenance, and collector relationships are fragmented
- Your artistic journey is invisible — even to you

**For Collectors:**
- Your collection exists as disconnected tokens across chains
- You can't see relationships between pieces, artists, or moments in time
- The story of how your collection formed is lost
- No way to appreciate or share your collection as a whole

## What ARCHIV-IT Does

### 1. Multi-Chain Indexing
Reads from Ethereum, Tezos, Solana, Bitcoin/Ordinals, WAX, and more. One view across all your activity.

### 2. Visual Archive Interface
Your work and collection visualized — not as a list, but as a living, navigable space.

### 3. Relationship Mapping
See connections: who collected what, when, and how pieces relate across time and theme.

### 4. Local-First Privacy
Your data stays on your machine. No external servers storing your archive.

### 5. Export & Preservation
Package your archive for backup, sharing, or legacy preservation.
