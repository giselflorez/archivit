## 2. PATENT-ELIGIBLE INNOVATIONS

### A. Recursive Cross-Platform Verification System

**Conception Date:** January 9, 2026
**Status:** PATENT REVIEW RECOMMENDED

**Abstract:**
A system and method for recursive identity and authenticity verification combining blockchain provenance data with social media signals in a multi-layer feedback loop.

**Novel Claims:**
1. Method for recursive identity verification combining blockchain provenance with social media signals
2. System for detecting wash trading through collector network graph analysis
3. Method for temporal behavioral fingerprinting to authenticate creator identity
4. System for cross-chain identity clustering without explicit wallet linking
5. Method for computing trust scores from weighted multi-source verification signals

**Distinguishing Factors:**
- Recursive feedback loop (each verification layer improves others)
- Multi-dimensional vs. single-source verification
- Creator/artist-focused vs. generic identity
- Local-first architecture (user controls verification data)

### B. Five-Paradigm Visualization System

**Conception Date:** January 1, 2026

**Abstract:**
A multi-paradigm visualization system for representing NFT/collector networks using five distinct modes with physics-based layout.

**The Five Paradigms:**
1. Temporal Flow - Works positioned along time axis
2. Conceptual Clustering - Works grouped by thematic similarity
3. Stewardship Mapping - Collector relationships by engagement depth
4. River Flow - Provenance as flowing water metaphor
5. Cultural Resonance - Works positioned by contextual significance

### C. Living Work State Tracking

**Conception Date:** January 1, 2026

**Abstract:**
A system for monitoring and archiving temporal states of reactive NFTs including past state extraction, future event detection, and live reactivity tracking.

### D. Temporal Behavioral Fingerprinting

**Conception Date:** January 1, 2026

**Abstract:**
A method for authenticating creator identity through analysis of unconscious behavioral patterns including minting time preferences, interval consistency, and gas price tolerance.

## 8. ARTERY/BLOODFLOW VISUALIZATION SYSTEM (NEW IP - January 9, 2026)

### Innovation Description

A biological visualization metaphor representing blockchain provenance and collector networks as circulatory systems:

**Visual Mapping:**
| Blockchain Concept | Biological Metaphor | Visual Encoding |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| NFT transfers | Blood cells | Animated particles flowing through tubes |
| Collector wallets | Organs/nodes | 3D nodes at tube intersections |
| Transaction volume | Artery diameter | Tube radius scales with activity |
| Transaction recency | Pulse frequency | Animation speed of flow |
| Transaction value | Blood color | Color intensity (deeper red = higher value) |
| Wash trading | Blood clots | Visual blockages, unhealthy patterns |
| Healthy network | Good circulation | Smooth, distributed flow |

### Technical Architecture

```
PyTorch/NumPy Backend          WebGPU Frontend
────────────────────          ─────────────────
• Compute flow metrics    →   • Render tube geometry
• Detect anomalies        →   • Animate blood particles
• Predict future flows    →   • Pulse effects
• Stream at 60fps         →   • Update buffers only
```

**Key Innovation:** Geometry computed once; only animation buffers stream in real-time. Enables complex ML predictions with smooth visualization.

### Patent Claims (Potential)

1. Method for visualizing blockchain transaction flow as biological circulation
2. System for real-time streaming of ML predictions to GPU visualization buffers
3. Method for detecting network anomalies through biological health metaphor
4. System for buffer-only animation updates without geometry recomputation

### Trademark Candidates

- **Provenance Arteries** ™
- **Chain Circulation** ™
- **Network Bloodflow** ™
- **Collector Heartbeat** ™

### Strategic Value

This visualization system could become the signature visual language for:
- ARCHIV-IT (collector network health)
- IT-R8 (data flow visualization)
- Future verified social platform (trust visualization)

The biological metaphor makes complex authenticity data instantly understandable - users "feel" network health rather than reading numbers.

### Connection to Recursive Verification

The ML layer (Recursive Verification System) computes trust scores.
The visualization layer (Artery/Bloodflow) makes them viscerally understandable.

Together, they form a complete "verified social" foundation:
- Backend: Multi-source recursive trust computation
- Frontend: Intuitive biological health visualization

### Ongoing
7. Maintain confidentiality of algorithm implementations
8. Document all new innovations with priority dates
9. Monitor for potential infringement
