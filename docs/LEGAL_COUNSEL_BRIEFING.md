# LEGAL COUNSEL BRIEFING
## ARCHIV-IT Ecosystem - Pre-Launch Preparation

**Prepared For:** Legal Counsel Meeting
**Prepared By:** Gisel Florez, Founder
**Date:** January 10, 2026
**Jurisdiction:** New York, United States
**Classification:** External - Safe for Legal Review

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ARCHIV-IT is a digital sovereignty software platform designed to help creators archive, create, and share their work while maintaining complete ownership of their data. The platform consists of three interconnected applications under one umbrella brand.

**Key Points for Counsel:**
- Software platform (not a financial product)
- Local-first architecture (user data stays on user's device)
- No custody of user funds or assets
- Open to blockchain integration but not a blockchain company
- Built using AI-assisted development (Claude Opus 4.5)
- Seeking NY business registration and IP protection

## 1. WHAT IS ARCHIV-IT?

### The Ecosystem Structure

```
ARCHIV-IT (Umbrella Brand)
│
├── DOC-8    - Database & Archive Application
├── IT-R8    - Creative Output Application
└── SOCI-8   - Social Sharing Application
```

### Plain Language Description

**ARCHIV-IT** is software that helps digital artists and creators:
1. **Organize** their creative work (DOC-8)
2. **Create** new works from their archives (IT-R8)
3. **Share** their work while keeping control (SOCI-8)

Think of it as: "A private database + creative studio + social network that runs on your own computer, not in the cloud."

### What Makes It Different

| Traditional Platforms | ARCHIV-IT |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Data stored on company servers | Data stored on user's device |
| Company owns/accesses user data | User owns all their data |
| Algorithms serve platform metrics | Algorithms serve user goals |
| Difficult to export/leave | Easy export, user can leave anytime |
| Free tier supported by ads/data sale | Free tier with no ads, no data sale |

## 2. HOW IT WAS BUILT

### Development Method

The software was developed using **AI-assisted programming**:

- **Human:** Gisel Florez (Founder, Creative Director)
- **AI Assistant:** Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic's AI model)
- **Environment:** VS Code IDE + Terminal on macOS
- **Method:** Conversational development with AI generating code based on founder's specifications

### What This Means Legally

**The founder:**
- Provided all creative direction, specifications, and decisions
- Reviewed and approved all code
- Owns all intellectual property as the directing mind

**The AI:**
- Generated code based on instructions
- Has no ownership claims (per Anthropic's terms of service)
- Functioned as a tool, similar to using any other software

### Relevant Precedent Considerations

1. **Copyright:** US Copyright Office guidance on AI-generated works is evolving. The founder provided substantial creative direction, specification, and review of all code. Current requirements should be discussed with counsel.

2. **Work Product:** The AI was used as a tool in the creative process, similar to using Photoshop or other software.

3. **Documentation:** Full development history is preserved in git commits with timestamps, demonstrating human direction throughout.

## 3. BUSINESS STRUCTURE

### Current Status

- **Entity:** Gisel Florez Studio Inc. (existing)
- **Project:** ARCHIV-IT (product line)
- **Stage:** Pre-launch development

### Proposed Structure (For Discussion)

**Option A:** Launch under existing entity
- Gisel Florez Studio Inc. owns ARCHIV-IT
- Simpler, faster to market

**Option B:** Create separate entity
- New LLC or Corp for ARCHIV-IT specifically
- Liability separation
- Cleaner for potential investment

### Revenue Model (Planned)

```
FREE TIER (Core Features):
- Full local functionality
- No advertisements
- No data collection
- Unlimited personal use

PAID TIER (Premium Features):
- Cloud backup (optional, encrypted)
- Commercial licensing
- Priority support
- Advanced collaboration tools
```

**Important:** The free tier is genuinely free with no hidden monetization through ads or data sale. This is a core principle, not just marketing.

## 5. DATA & PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

### Architecture Overview

```
USER'S DEVICE                          EXTERNAL (Optional)
─────────────                          ─────────────────────
[User's Data] ←──── stays here         [Cloud Backup] - encrypted, optional
[Software]    ←──── runs here          [Blockchain Read] - public data only
[Analysis]    ←──── happens here       [IPFS] - user-initiated only
```

### Key Privacy Features

1. **Local-First:** All user data stored on user's device by default
2. **No Telemetry:** No analytics, tracking, or usage data collected
3. **No Account Required:** Software works without creating an account
4. **Full Export:** Users can export all data in standard formats
5. **Real Deletion:** Delete means delete (no hidden retention)

### Regulatory Considerations

**GDPR (if serving EU users):**
- Local-first architecture naturally compliant
- No data processing on our servers = minimal obligations
- User controls all their data

**CCPA (California):**
- Similar benefits from local-first design
- No "sale" of personal information
- Easy deletion compliance

**NY Privacy Laws:**
- NY SHIELD Act: Security requirements for NY resident data
- Since data stays local, security is user's responsibility
- We provide tools, not custody

---

## 6. BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION

### Current Scope

The software can **read** blockchain data:
- Track NFT ownership across chains
- Verify provenance of digital art
- Display collection information

### What We Do NOT Do

- Do not custody cryptocurrency or tokens
- Do not facilitate transactions
- Do not provide financial advice
- Do not operate as a money transmitter
- Do not issue tokens or securities

### Regulatory Classification

Based on current functionality:
- **Not a Money Transmitter:** No funds custody or transfer
- **Not a Securities Platform:** No investment products
- **Not an Exchange:** No trading functionality
- **Software Tool:** Reads public blockchain data, similar to a block explorer

### Future Considerations

If features expand to include:
- NFT minting → May need terms of service updates
- Payment processing → Would need compliance review
- Token issuance → Would need securities analysis

---

## 7. NY REGISTRATION CONSIDERATIONS

### Potential Complications

**1. AI-Assisted Development**
- Question: Does AI involvement affect IP ownership?
- Position: Founder directed all development; AI was a tool
- Evidence: Complete git history with human commits

**2. Open Source Components**
- Software uses open-source libraries (standard practice)
- All licenses are permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- No GPL "copyleft" contamination of proprietary code

**3. Blockchain Association**
- May trigger additional scrutiny
- Position: Read-only integration, no financial services
- Similar to: Portfolio tracking apps, block explorers

**4. Data Privacy Claims**
- Strong privacy claims must be accurate
- Architecture genuinely supports claims
- Documentation exists to prove technical implementation

**5. Free Tier Sustainability**
- "Free forever" claims must be sustainable
- Business model relies on premium tier
- No hidden monetization that contradicts free tier promises

### Recommended Registrations

1. **Business Registration:** Confirm existing entity or form new
2. **Trademark Applications:** File for ARCHIV-IT, DOC-8, IT-R8, SOCI-8
3. **Copyright Registration:** Register software and key documentation
4. **Patent Evaluation:** Review innovations for filing decisions

## FOUNDER STATEMENT

I, Gisel Florez, am building ARCHIV-IT to give creators control over their digital lives. After years in the digital art space, I've seen how platforms extract value from creators while giving little in return.

ARCHIV-IT is designed to flip that model: the software serves the user, not the platform. Users own their data, control their experience, and can leave anytime with everything they brought.

I've built this with AI assistance because it allowed me to move faster and build something more sophisticated than I could alone. But every decision, every feature, every line of code reflects my vision for what creator tools should be.

I'm seeking legal counsel to ensure this launches properly - with the right protections for both the business and the users who will trust it with their creative work.
