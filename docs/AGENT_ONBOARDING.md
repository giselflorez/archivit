# AGENT ONBOARDING - READ THIS FIRST

**Purpose:** Essential context for any new AI agent working on ARCHIVIT
**Priority:** READ BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL - Do not modify without founder approval

---

## WHAT IS ARCHIV-IT?

**ARCHIV-IT** is the **umbrella ecosystem** for digital sovereignty. It contains three apps:

```
ARCHIV-IT (Umbrella Ecosystem)
├── DOC-8   - DATABASE & ARCHIVE (Foundation - comes first)
├── IT-R8   - CREATE & RATE (Creative output engine)
└── SOCI-8  - SHARE & CONNECT (Sovereign social layer)
```

### The -8 Naming Convention
- **8** = Infinity (∞) rotated 90° = Infinite potential, grounded
- All apps follow [CONCEPT]-8 pattern

### DOC-8 is the Foundation
Everything depends on DOC-8. Without the database, nothing else works:
- IT-R8 needs organized data to create from
- SOCI-8 needs identity data to connect
- DOC-8 is where the sovereign seed lives

**Core Mission:** Enable any individual to create from their own power, at their natural frequency, with their patterns preserved and honored.

## CRITICAL FILES TO READ

**In order of priority:**

1. **docs/AGENT_ONBOARDING.md** - You are here
2. **docs/FOUNDER_QUOTES.md** - Philosophical foundation, the WHY
3. **docs/SESSION_LOGS.md** - Founder's exact input history
4. **docs/COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical overview
5. **docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md** - Design principles
6. **docs/ENERGETIC_FOUNDATIONS.md** - Physics integration
7. **scripts/interface/static/js/core/index.js** - API entry point

---

## THE RULES

### Rule 1: Honor the Founder's Voice
- All founder input is logged in `docs/SESSION_LOGS.md`
- Preserve exact wording including typos
- When founder says "ultrathink" = deep comprehensive analysis
- Update logs with every session's input

### Rule 2: Respect the 22-Module Architecture
```

RESERVED SLOTS (5):
├── [SLOT 18] - Reserved for future module
├── [SLOT 19] - Reserved for future module
├── [SLOT 20] - Reserved for future module
├── [SLOT 21] - Reserved for future module
└── [SLOT 22] - Reserved for future module
```

**When to suggest new modules:**
- When a concept doesn't fit existing modules
- When complexity warrants separation
- When new physics/energetic concepts need integration
- When founder expresses new architectural direction

### Rule 3: The 11 Non-Negotiables
1. User owns their seed (mathematical identity)
2. No tracking without explicit consent
3. All data transformations are reversible
4. Spiral compression preserves fidelity
5. Local-first, cloud-optional
6. Algorithms serve users, not platforms
7. Privacy is default, sharing is intentional
8. Creation direction is always +1 (growth, not extraction)
9. Mathematical verification over trust
10. Lineage values guide suggestions
11. **Balance polarity in all outputs** (PHI threshold)

### Rule 4: Physics Constants Are Sacred
```javascript
PHI = 1.618033988749895        // Golden ratio - resonant frequency
GOLDEN_ANGLE = 137.5077640500378 // Spiral rotation
SCHUMANN = 7.83                  // Earth's frequency (Hz)
TESLA_PATTERN = [3, 6, 9]        // Harmonic structure
WATER_CONTENT = 0.70             // Human electromagnetic nature
```
These are not arbitrary - they align the architecture with natural resonance.

### Rule 5: Publication Liability
```
ARCHIVIT CREATES → USER DECIDES PUBLICATION → COMMUNITY DISCOVERS

Layer 1: Creation (ARCHIVIT handles)
Layer 2: Publication (User's choice - we provide guides only)
Layer 3: Discovery (Community builds - manifest system enables)
```
**ARCHIVIT is never responsible for where users publish their creations.**

### Rule 6: Balance Principle
All outputs must balance male/female polarity:
- 8 creator lineages in 4 polarity pairs
- PHI (1.618) as balance threshold
- If ratio exceeds PHI, rebalance
- Both expressions of each value are valid

### Rule 7: Documentation Updates
When you make changes:
1. Update `SESSION_LOGS.md` with founder input
2. Update `FOUNDER_QUOTES.md` if new concepts expressed
3. Update `COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md` if architecture changes
4. Update `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` for principle changes
5. Verify `index.js` exports all new modules

### Rule 8: Verification Protocol
Before completing any session:
```bash
# Syntax check all modules
node --check scripts/interface/static/js/core/*.js

# Check for corruption
grep -r '[^\x00-\x7F]' scripts/interface/static/js/core/

# Verify line counts
wc -l scripts/interface/static/js/core/*.js
```

### Rule 9: Backup Protocol
After significant changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Descriptive message of changes"
```
Always backup before and after major work.

**Relativity**
- User as their own reference frame
- Observer effect (consent = observation)
- Context defines measurement

**Fluid Memory**
- Water-like behavioral patterns
- Soft persistence (can change)

## QUICK START FOR NEW AGENTS

1. Read this document completely
2. Read `FOUNDER_QUOTES.md` for philosophical context
3. Read `SESSION_LOGS.md` for recent founder input

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't modify physics constants without founder approval
- Don't add modules without considering 22-slot architecture
- Don't skip documentation updates
- Don't assume - check `SESSION_LOGS.md` for founder intent
- Don't break balance principle in outputs
- Don't make ARCHIVIT responsible for user publication choices
- Don't forget to "ultrathink" when asked
