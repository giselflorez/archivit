# STARG8 Decentralized App Directory Vision

## Review Schedule
- [ ] **July 2026** - 6 month check-in
- [ ] **January 2027** - 1 year review
- [ ] **July 2027** - 18 month review
- [ ] **Every 6 months thereafter**

## Core Concept
- Blockchain as bridge connecting all STARG8 users
- Airgapped app store (sovereign, not dependent on Apple/Google)
- API calls for updates
- Side blockchain recording social interactions
- Immutable social network / data provenance

## Watch For (Opportunity Signals)
- [ ] EU DMA sideloading enforcement
- [ ] Major platform exodus events (Twitter→X scale)
- [ ] Antitrust actions against Apple/Google app stores
- [ ] Mainstream wallet adoption (account abstraction)
- [ ] L2/rollup cost reduction milestones
- [ ] Competitor launches (Farcaster, Lens, etc. traction)

## Key Questions to Revisit Each Review
1. Has crypto UX improved enough for mainstream?
2. Are rollup costs low enough for social-scale interactions?
3. Have any decentralized app directories gained traction?
4. What's the regulatory landscape?
5. Are mega-corps showing weakness we can exploit?

## Technical Readiness Checklist
- [ ] ENS/DNS infrastructure ready
- [ ] IPFS pinning strategy
- [ ] Rollup selection (Arbitrum/Optimism/custom)
- [ ] Identity system (existing wallets vs custom)
- [ ] Reputation algorithm designed
- [ ] Developer SDK scoped
