## INVENTION #1: Pi-Quadratic Seed Identity System (PQS)

### Disclosure Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Pi-Quadratic Seed Identity: Mathematical Derivation of Sovereign Digital Identity |
| **Inventor(s)** | [FOUNDER] |
| **Conception Date** | 2025 (exact date in git history) |
| **Reduction to Practice** | 2026-01-XX (working implementation) |
| **Status** | NOVEL - No known prior art |

### Technical Description

A method for generating deterministic, sovereign digital identity from user-generated entropy using:

1. **Genesis Entropy Collection**: User-generated randomness (mouse movements, timing entropy)
2. **Pi-Quadratic Transform**: Mathematical transformation using π and φ (golden ratio) constants
3. **Vertex Calculation**: Positioning identity in golden-ratio coordinate space
4. **Hierarchical Key Derivation**: All cryptographic keys derived from single seed via HKDF

**Key Innovation:** Unlike BIP-39 (Bitcoin) which uses word lists, PQS uses mathematical constants (π, φ, Schumann resonance) to create a coordinate-based identity that maps to behavioral patterns.

### Claims

1. A method of generating digital identity coordinates using pi-quadratic transformation
2. A system where user behavior updates vertex position in golden-ratio space
3. A method of deriving cryptographic keys from mathematically-positioned identity
4. Integration of sacred geometry constants (PHI, GOLDEN_ANGLE) into identity generation

## INVENTION #2: Quantum Containment Access Control (ACU-Gated)

### Disclosure Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Quantum Containment: Gaming-Resistant Access Control Using Fibonacci-Weighted Behavioral Analysis |
| **Inventor(s)** | [FOUNDER] |
| **Conception Date** | 2026-01-14 |
| **Reduction to Practice** | 2026-01-14 |
| **Status** | NOVEL - Unique approach |

### Technical Description

A multi-layer access control system resistant to gaming/manipulation:

1. **History Gate**: Minimum 21 actions required (Fibonacci number)
2. **Fibonacci-Weighted ACU**: Older actions weighted MORE heavily (rewards consistency over bursts)
3. **Variance Check**: Detects oscillating good/bad patterns (σ² < 0.25 required)
4. **Equilibrium of Light**: Light ratio must exceed φ^(-1) = 0.618 for advanced tiers

**Key Innovation:** Uses golden ratio thresholds for access tiers:
- BLOCKED: ACU < 0.236 (φ^(-2))
- DEGRADED: 0.236 ≤ ACU < 0.382
- PARTIAL: 0.382 ≤ ACU < 0.618
- FULL: ACU ≥ 0.618 (φ^(-1))
- SOVEREIGN: ACU ≥ 0.786 (φ^(-0.5))

### Claims

1. A method of access control using Fibonacci-weighted behavioral history
2. A system where older positive actions contribute more than recent actions
3. A method of detecting gaming attempts via variance analysis
4. Use of golden ratio thresholds for tiered access levels
5. Mathematical proof that gaming is economically irrational

## INVENTION #3: Quantum Provenance Model (Superposition-Based)

### Disclosure Information

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Quantum Provenance: Amplitude-Based Modeling of Disputed Artwork Ownership |
| **Inventor(s)** | [FOUNDER] |
| **Conception Date** | 2026-01-16 |
| **Reduction to Practice** | 2026-01-16 |
| **Status** | NOVEL - Conceptual innovation |

### Technical Description

A novel approach to provenance that models disputed ownership as quantum superposition:

1. **Superposition State**: Multiple provenance claims coexist with probability amplitudes
2. **Evidence Amplitudes**: Each evidence type has base amplitude (blockchain mint: 0.90, social media: 0.40)
3. **Quantum Interference**: Consistent evidence reinforces (constructive), contradictory cancels (destructive)
4. **State Collapse**: Verification "collapses" superposition to most probable claim
5. **Entanglement**: Related artworks share correlated provenance states

**Mathematical Model:**
```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|claimᵢ⟩

where |αᵢ|² = probability of claim i being true
Normalization: Σᵢ|αᵢ|² = 1
```

### Claims

1. A method of modeling disputed provenance as quantum superposition of claims
2. A system assigning probability amplitudes to evidence types
3. A method of applying quantum interference to reinforcing/contradicting claims
4. A method of "collapsing" provenance state upon authoritative verification
5. A system of "entangling" related artworks for correlated provenance updates
6. Use of Shannon entropy to measure provenance uncertainty
7. Use of golden ratio (φ) to determine if claims need resolution

2. **PQC Layer**: Post-quantum cryptographic keys (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65)
3. **Single Genesis**: Both layers derive from same user entropy
4. **Ownership Proofs**: Combine behavioral proof + quantum signature

**Key Innovation:** First system to unify behavioral identity metrics with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography under a single seed.
