# ARCHIV-IT Branding Statement Iterations

## Original Statement (47 words)
> **What it is:** A local-first software system that indexes your blockchain art across all chains, visualizes your body of work as navigable space, and maps your collector relationships over time. Everything runs on your machine. Your data never leaves.

## NOTE FOR FUTURE AGENTS: PDF Output Styling

**PRIMARY REFERENCE:** `/docs/LIGHT_MODE_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — Full specification
**TEMPLATE FILE:** `/docs/branding_preview.html` — Working implementation

### Quick Reference
- Background: #fafafa (warm white, not pure white)
- Gold accent: #d4a574 (unchanged from dark theme)
- Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (brand) + Inter (body)
- ONE animated element maximum (subtle glow pulse)
- Left-border accent bar in gold (60% opacity)
- Text hierarchy via rgba opacity, not just size
- Quiet authority — archival, not marketing

### Selected Statement (Faerie Iteration)
> Navigate your body of work. Watch collector relationships unfold over time. Your blockchain art, indexed across chains. Runs locally, data stays yours.

### Tagline
> Your Data. Your Output. Take Control.

## Six Archetypal Iterations (Condensed)

Each iteration restructures emphasis and rhythm based on the archetype's cognitive strategy—same core meaning, one-third shorter.

---

### 1. THE DOCTORATE OF THOUGHT
*Precision, systematic categorization, axioms*

> A local-first system: indexes your blockchain art across chains; visualizes your body of work spatially; maps collector relationships over time. Runs on your machine. Data never leaves.

---

### 2. THE PHILOSOPHER OF JUSTICE
*Rights-first, sovereignty as foundation*

> Your art, indexed across chains. Your body of work, navigable. Your collector relationships, mapped over time. Local-first—runs on your machine. Your data never leaves.

---

### 3. THE MAGICIAN OF PROWESS
*Confident action, the reveal*

> Index your art across all chains. Visualize your body of work. Map your collectors over time. Local-first—everything on your machine. Data never leaves.

---

### 4. THE FAERIE OF CHANCE
*Exploration, discovery, possibility*

> Navigate your body of work. Watch collector relationships unfold over time. Your blockchain art, indexed across chains. Runs locally, data stays yours.

---

### 5. THE ARCHITECT OF SYSTEMS
*Foundation first, structure*

> Local-first. Runs on your machine; data never leaves. Indexes your blockchain art, visualizes your body of work, maps collector relationships over time.

---

### 6. THE KEEPER OF MEMORY
*Time, accumulation, preservation*

> Collector relationships mapped over time. Blockchain art indexed across chains. Body of work made navigable. Local-first—your machine, your data, always.

---

## Three Normal Reconfigurings (Condensed)

---

### NORMAL A: Privacy First

> Runs on your machine. Data never leaves. Indexes your blockchain art across chains, visualizes your body of work, maps collector relationships over time.

---

### NORMAL B: Capabilities Forward

> Index your art across chains. Visualize your body of work. Map collector relationships. Local-first—runs on your machine, data never leaves.

---

### NORMAL C: Smooth Flow

> Local-first software that indexes your blockchain art, visualizes your body of work, and maps collector relationships. Everything on your machine. Data never leaves.

## Recommendation

The **Philosopher of Justice** iteration most directly serves the ARCHIV-IT mission—it places artist sovereignty at the grammatical and moral center of the statement. The system exists to serve the artist's rights, not the other way around.

However, the **Architect of Systems** version may be strongest for documentation, as it establishes trust through structural transparency.

Consider using different iterations in different contexts:
- **Landing page:** Magician (confident demonstration)
- **About/Values:** Philosopher (rights-centered)
- **Technical docs:** Doctorate or Architect
- **Artist onboarding:** Faerie (invitation to explore)
