## PART 1: CHOOSING YOUR STRUCTURE

### Option A: Form Your Own 501(c)(3)

**Pros:**
- Full control
- Your own brand/name
- Direct tax-deductible donations
- Permanent structure

**Cons:**
- $375-700 setup costs
- 4-8 months timeline
- Annual compliance requirements
- Need board of directors (min 3 in NY)

### Option B: Fiscal Sponsorship

**Pros:**
- Start immediately (days, not months)
- $0 upfront cost
- Sponsor handles compliance
- Tax-deductible donations through sponsor

**Cons:**
- 5-10% fee on donations
- Less autonomy
- Sponsor's name on legal documents
- May need to transition later

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

```
PHASE 1 (Immediate):
────────────────────
Use fiscal sponsor to start accepting donations
and operating tax-exempt immediately.

PHASE 2 (6-12 months):
──────────────────────
Form your own 501(c)(3) once you have:
- Proven concept
- Board members identified
- Some funding/activity

This is what many successful projects do.
```
